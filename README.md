Summary and conclusion:

Each ecommerce business uses a different strategy to survive in this competitive market. Thus, we create a successful business model that can be used by an ecommerce application which sells products from small to large scale. 
The ways that a business can outstand its competition is by making sure the products are legit and promises to deliver what is described. This can be checked frequently in order to maintain the business integrity.
                       Customer’s feedback should be constantly monitored to keep the products and their merchants in check. As a feedback towards a product is a feedback toward the business itself. By introducing innovative product promotion campaigns like coupons and add boosters 
We can bring in more frequent buyers and new shoppers.
